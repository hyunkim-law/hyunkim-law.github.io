<ul>
  <li>DELAYED till she had ceased to know,</li>
  <li>Delayed till in its vest of snow</li>
  <li class="indent-2">Her loving bosom lay.</li>
  <li>An hour behind the fleeting breath,</li>
  <li>Later by just an hour than death,â€”</li>
  <li class="indent-2">
    <p>Oh, lagging yesterday!</p>
  </li>
  <li>Could she have guessed that it would be;</li>
  <li>Could but a crier of the glee</li>
  <li class="indent-2">Have climbed the distant hill;</li>
  <li>Had not the bliss so slow a pace,â€”</li>
  <li>Who knows but this surrendered face</li>
  <li class="indent-2">
    <p>Were undefeated still?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Oh, if there may departing be</li>
  <li>Any forgot by victory</li>
  <li class="indent-2">In her imperial round,</li>
  <li>Show them this meek apparelled thing,</li>
  <li>That could not stop to be a king,</li>
  <li class="indent-2">Doubtful if it be crowned!</li>
</ul>
