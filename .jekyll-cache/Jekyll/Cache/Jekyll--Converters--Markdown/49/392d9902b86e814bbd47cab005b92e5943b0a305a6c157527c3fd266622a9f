  <li>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won,</li>
  <li>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</li>
  <li>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</li>
  <li class="indent-3">But O heart! heart! heart!</li>
  <li class="indent-4">O the bleeding drops of red,</li>
  <li class="indent-5">Where on the deck my Captain lies,</li>
  <li class="indent-6">
    <p>Fallen cold and dead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</li>
  <li>Rise upâ€”for you the flag is flungâ€”for you the bugle<sup id="fnref:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> trills,</li>
  <li>For you bouquets and ribbonâ€™d wreathsâ€”for you the shores a-crowding,</li>
  <li>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</li>
  <li class="indent-3">Here Captain! dear father!</li>
  <li class="indent-4">This arm beneath your head!</li>
  <li class="indent-5">It is some dream that on the deck,</li>
  <li class="indent-6">
    <p>Youâ€™ve fallen cold and dead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<sup id="fnref:fn3"><a href="#fn:fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</li>
  <li>The ship is anchorâ€™d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</li>
  <li>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</li>
  <li class="indent-3">Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</li>
  <li class="indent-4">But I with mournful tread,</li>
  <li class="indent-5">Walk the deck my Captain lies,</li>
  <li class="indent-6">Fallen cold and dead.</li>

      <p>The author had just landed in La Guardia Airport after the flight captain died. All the passengers stood up to applaud the co-pilot. We have it in good authority that the event in question led Yoko Ono to write her â€œLetter to Johnâ€:</p>

      <blockquote class="poetry">
        <ul>
          <li>On a windy day letâ€™s go flying</li>
          <li>There may be no trees to rest on</li>
          <li>There may be no clouds to ride</li>
          <li>But weâ€™ll have our wings and the wind will be with us</li>
          <li>Thatâ€™s enough for me, thatâ€™s enough for me.</li>
