<p>MAMA: Son—how come you talk so much ‘bout money?</p>

<p>WALTER (<em>with immense passion</em>): Because it is life, Mama!</p>

<p>MAMA: Oh—So now it’s life. Money is life. Once upon a time freedom used to be life—now it’s money. I guess the world really do change …</p>

<p>WALTER: No—it was always money, Mama. We just didn’t know about it.</p>

<p>MAMA: No . . . something has changed. (<em>She looks at him</em>) You something new, boy. In my time we was worried about not being lynched and getting to the North if we could and how to stay alive and still have a pinch of dignity too … Now here come you and Beneatha—talking ‘bout things we never even thought about hardly, me and your daddy. You ain’t satisfied or proud of nothing we done. I mean that you had a home; that we kept you out of trouble till you was grown; that you don’t have to ride to work on the back of nobody’s streetcar—You my children—but how different we done become.</p>
